Cellular IoT solutions are new standards defined by the 3GPP Group to answer requirements such as **low power, long range and low data rate usage**. Two standards currently exist - LTE Cat.M1 is one of the current standards and is intended for low bandwidth intermittent use, as expected for an IOT-type device.

Cat M1 can deliver secure, world-wide coverage by using the same base stations, public networks and power supplies as mobile phones.

It is important to recognize that Cat M1 is not the same as 4G LTE data bandwidth you have come to expect on your cell phone data plan. This is not suitable for streaming video, instead it would be intended more for intermittent low bandwidth telemetry or sensor data.

Generally speaking LTE Cat M1 modems are designed to support these features: 

* High Security, Encrypted communication and FOTA
* Low consumption capable of 10+ years of battery life
* Wide coverage using existing smartphone networks
* Low cost - Reduction of R&D and operational cost
* GPS-free geolocation solution
* Large network capacity w/ reduction of data rate
